# Advent of Code 2024

Another year of Advent of Code! This time we will be using... Clojure!


# Puzzle Input

To solve, place your puzzle input under `resources/day_x/input.txt`.
Alternatively, if you set an environment variable of `AOC_SESSION_ID` from your
`session=*` in the AOC Cookie, the `aoc/input` function will automatically fetch it for you.
